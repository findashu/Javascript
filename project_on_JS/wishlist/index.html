    <h1>JavaScript wishlist example</h1>

    <p>
        In this example, we're going to write a small application that lets us add products to a wishlist. Please note
        that it's 100% client side and we don't store any data, so if you refresh your page: the wishlist will be
        emptied.
    </p>

    <p>
        This example has 3 products, each product has its Add to wishlist button. When we click on this button, the
        product will be added to the wishlist, which will then be refresh and displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will create a the prototype object to create a class that will be responsible to manage the wishlist. The
        skeleton of this class is already created, you will need to write the methods not implemented.
    </p>
    <span><b>Note</b> <i>Please read the instructions in app.js and try to implement.</i></span>

    <h2>Products</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Product 1</span>
            <button id="product-1" data-id="P1" data-name="Product 1" class="add-to-wishlist">Add to wishlist</button>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Product 2</span>
            <button id="product-2" data-id="P2" data-name="Product 2" class="add-to-wishlist">Add to wishlist</button>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Product 3</span>
            <button id="product-3" data-id="P3" data-name="Product 3" class="add-to-wishlist">Add to wishlist</button>
